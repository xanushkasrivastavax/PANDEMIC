          FIGHTING COVID-19 AT HOME
        </h4>
        <br />
        <p>
          The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are a fever, coughing, and
          breathing problems. Unless you have severe symptoms, you can most
          likely treat them at home, the way you would for a cold or the flu.
          Most people recover from COVID-19 without the need for hospital care.
          Call your doctor to ask about whether you should stay home or get
          medical care in person.
        </p>
        <p>
          Scientists are trying to make new medicines and test some existing
          drugs to see whether they can treat COVID-19. In the meantime, there
          are a number of things that can relieve symptoms, both at home and at
          the hospital.
        </p>
        <h5>At-Home Coronavirus Treatment</h5>
        <div>
          If your symptoms are mild enough that you can recover at home, you
          should:
        </div>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Rest. It can make you feel better and may speed your recovery.
          </li>
          <li>Stay home. Don't go to work, school, or public places.</li>
          <li>
            Drink fluids. You lose more water when you're sick. Dehydration can
            make symptoms worse and cause other health problems.
          </li>
          <li>
            Monitor. If your symptoms get worse, call your doctor right away.
            Don't go to their office without calling first. They might tell you
            to stay home, or they may need to take extra steps to protect staff
            and other patients.
          </li>
          <li>
            Ask your doctor about over-the-counter medicines that may help, like
            acetaminophen to lower your fever. The most important thing to do is
            to avoid infecting other people, especially those who are over 65 or
            who have other health problems.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h5>What to expect</h5>
        <p>
          Symptoms begin 2 to 14 days after you come into contact with the
          virus. Early studies show that many people who have mild infections
          recover within 2 weeks. More severe cases tend to last 3 to 6 weeks.
        </p>
        <p>
          Talk to your doctor about how long you should isolate yourself if you
          have symptoms. CDC guidelines say you can leave isolation when all of
          these are true:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>You haven’t had a fever for 3 days.</li>
          <li>
            Your respiratory symptoms, such as coughing or shortness of breath,
            are better.
          </li>
          <li>
            It’s been at least 10 days since your symptoms began OR you have two
            negative COVID-19 tests 24 hours apart.
          </li>
          <p>How do you know if your symptoms are getting worse?</p>
          <p>Get medical care right away if you begin to have:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Trouble breathing</li>
            <li>Pain or pressure in your chest</li>
            <li>Confusion or severe drowsiness</li>
            <li>A blue tint to your lips or face</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
        <p>
          You don't need to go to the hospital or ER if you have basic COVID-19
          symptoms, like a mild fever or cough. If you do, many hospitals will
          send you home.
